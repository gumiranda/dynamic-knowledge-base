# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Dynamic Knowledge Base System is a RESTful API that manages interconnected topics and resources with advanced features including version control, hierarchical organization, user roles, and permissions. The system enables users to create, manage, and navigate through a structured knowledge repository with complex relationships between topics and associated resources.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to set up and configure the knowledge base system, so that it can be deployed and used by different types of users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is initialized THEN it SHALL create a Node.js project with TypeScript configuration
2. WHEN the server starts THEN it SHALL initialize an Express server on a configurable port
3. WHEN the system requires data persistence THEN it SHALL use an in-memory or file-based JSON database
4. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL validate all required dependencies and configurations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be registered and authenticated in the system, so that I can access knowledge base features according to my role.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new user is created THEN the system SHALL assign them a unique ID, name, email, role, and creation timestamp
2. WHEN a user role is assigned THEN it SHALL be one of: Admin, Editor, or Viewer
3. WHEN user data is stored THEN it SHALL include id, name, email, role, and createdAt properties
4. WHEN user authentication is required THEN the system SHALL validate user permissions based on their role

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an Editor or Admin, I want to create and manage topics with version control, so that I can build and maintain the knowledge base while preserving historical changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a topic is created THEN it SHALL have properties: id, name, content, createdAt, updatedAt, version, parentTopicId
2. WHEN a topic is updated THEN the system SHALL create a new version without overwriting the existing topic
3. WHEN a topic version is created THEN it SHALL increment the version number and update the updatedAt timestamp
4. WHEN a topic is requested THEN the system SHALL return the latest version by default
5. WHEN a specific topic version is requested THEN the system SHALL return that exact version
6. WHEN a topic is deleted THEN it SHALL be marked as deleted but remain accessible for version history

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an Editor or Admin, I want to organize topics hierarchically, so that I can create structured knowledge relationships with parent and child topics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a topic is created THEN it SHALL optionally reference a parentTopicId for hierarchical structure
2. WHEN a topic has a parent THEN the parent topic SHALL be able to list its child topics
3. WHEN a hierarchical relationship is created THEN it SHALL prevent circular references
4. WHEN a parent topic is deleted THEN the system SHALL handle orphaned child topics appropriately

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an Editor or Admin, I want to associate resources with topics, so that I can provide external references and supporting materials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a resource is created THEN it SHALL have properties: id, topicId, url, description, type, createdAt, updatedAt
2. WHEN a resource type is specified THEN it SHALL be one of: video, article, pdf, or other valid types
3. WHEN a resource is associated with a topic THEN it SHALL reference a valid existing topic
4. WHEN a topic is retrieved THEN it SHALL optionally include its associated resources
5. WHEN a resource URL is provided THEN the system SHALL validate the URL format

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to retrieve topics and their complete subtopic hierarchy, so that I can understand the full knowledge structure from any starting point.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a topic hierarchy is requested THEN the system SHALL return the topic and all its subtopics recursively
2. WHEN the hierarchy response is generated THEN it SHALL represent a tree structure with parent-child relationships
3. WHEN recursive retrieval is performed THEN it SHALL prevent infinite loops from circular references
4. WHEN a deep hierarchy is requested THEN the system SHALL handle performance efficiently

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to find the shortest path between two topics, so that I can understand the relationship and navigation route between different knowledge areas.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN two topic IDs are provided THEN the system SHALL calculate the shortest path between them
2. WHEN the path calculation is performed THEN it SHALL use a custom algorithm without external graph libraries
3. WHEN a path exists THEN the system SHALL return the sequence of topics connecting the two points
4. WHEN no path exists THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate message indicating disconnected topics
5. WHEN the algorithm runs THEN it SHALL handle large topic hierarchies efficiently

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want the codebase to follow advanced OOP principles and design patterns, so that the system is maintainable, scalable, and follows best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN entities are modeled THEN they SHALL use abstract classes and interfaces appropriately
2. WHEN topic versions are created THEN the system SHALL implement the Factory pattern
3. WHEN user permissions are checked THEN the system SHALL implement the Strategy pattern
4. WHEN hierarchical topics are managed THEN the system SHALL implement the Composite pattern
5. WHEN code is organized THEN it SHALL follow SOLID principles with clear separation of concerns

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and validation, so that the system provides clear feedback and maintains stability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN invalid input is provided THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messages with status codes
2. WHEN business logic fails THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully without crashing
3. WHEN validation is performed THEN it SHALL check all required fields and data formats
4. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with sufficient detail for debugging
5. WHEN API responses are sent THEN they SHALL follow consistent error response formats

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive testing coverage, so that the system reliability and functionality can be verified.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN unit tests are written THEN they SHALL cover all services and controllers
2. WHEN integration tests are created THEN they SHALL test complete user workflows
3. WHEN tests are executed THEN they SHALL achieve high coverage of critical business logic
4. WHEN dependencies are tested THEN they SHALL be properly mocked to isolate functionality
5. WHEN test suites run THEN they SHALL provide clear feedback on failures and coverage metrics
